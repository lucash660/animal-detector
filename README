# Animal Photo Sorting Tool

This project automatically groups similar RAW photos, detects animals, classifies the species, and moves the original files into species-specific folders.

---

## What this project does

1. Loads RAW photos (`.ARW`)
2. Groups visually similar photos (burst shots)
3. Detects animals using YOLO
4. Classifies the species using an iNat model
5. Moves the original RAW files into output folders by species

---

## Requirements

* Python **3.9 or newer**
* Internet connection (first run only, for model downloads)

All Python libraries are installed automatically.

---

## Setup (first time only)

### On macOS

1. Open **Terminal**
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/project
   ```
3. Run:

   ```bash
   bash setup.sh
   ```

This creates a virtual environment and installs all dependencies.

---

## Running the program

```bash
bash run.sh
```

## Notes

* Do **not** delete the `venv/` folder after setup

2. Check that the input folder contains `.ARW` files
